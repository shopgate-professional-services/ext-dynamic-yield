# Shopgate Connect - Extension dynamic-yield

The extension provides Dynamic Yield product recommendations via the Experience API.

See: https://dy.dev/reference/choosing-variations

The [@shopgate-project/product-recommendations](https://github.com/shopgate-professional-services/ext-product-recommendations) extension is required to display the recommendations in the frontend.

## Configuration

| key | type | description | example |
|---|---|---|---|
| apiKey | string | API auth key | `"f74h7879a2x9bc566fbecd366cd13fec89dd8i2188061156c70804161ffde08b"` |
| apiZone | string | API zone | `"com"` or `"eu"` |
| appLocation | string | App location | `"en_US"` or `"de_DE"` |
| pageTypes | array | Show recommendations on home page (widget) and/or on the PDP. If the array is empty, the page type "OTHER" is used. | `["PRODUCT", "HOMEPAGE"]` |
| campaignNames | array | Name of the campaigns | `["Mobile-App-Recs"]` |
| sendRequests | boolean | Send requests to Dynamic Yields for all devices |Â `true`

**Note:**

If `sendRequests` is set to `false`, the user can activate the requests by touching the header/logo for at least 5 seconds.

If the extension receives request options via extension `@shopgate-project/product-recommendations`, these options are given priority when processing the requests to Dynamic Yield.

**Example:**

```json
{
  "apiKey": "f74h7679a2c9bc566fbdcd366cd13fec89dd8i2188061156c70804189ffde08b",
